# Frontend App - JIRA-MCP Integration Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This React application now includes full integration with the MCP server for JIRA-driven UI development. You can fetch JIRA issues, generate components based on issue descriptions, and seamlessly integrate them into your application.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Start the Backend Server

The backend proxy server connects the React app to the MCP server:

```bash
cd c:\Priyanka\projects\frontendapp
node server/mcpProxy.js
```

The server will start on http://localhost:3002 and show:
```
Backend proxy server running on port 3002
MCP server spawned successfully
```

### 2. Start the React Development Server

```bash
cd c:\Priyanka\projects\frontendapp
npm start
```

The React app will start on http://localhost:3000

## 🧭 Navigation & Features

The application now includes a navigation bar with four main sections:

### 1. Enhanced Components (`/` or `/components`)
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates the SCRUM-1 enhanced UI components
- **Features**: 
  - Primary action components with loading states
  - Error handling demonstrations
  - Progress indicators for slow actions
  - Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
  - Responsive design

### 2. JIRA-MCP Integration (`/jira-mcp`)
- **Purpose**: Interactive interface for JIRA-driven development
- **Features**:
  - **Server Health Monitoring**: Real-time status of MCP server connection
  - **JIRA Issue Fetching**: Enter issue keys to fetch and display JIRA issues
  - **Component Generation**: Generate React components from JIRA descriptions
  - **MCP Tools Testing**: Test various MCP server capabilities
  - **Search Functionality**: Search JIRA issues by text queries

### 3. Login (`/login`)
- Standard login interface

### 4. Register (`/register`)
- User registration interface

## 🔧 JIRA-MCP Integration Features

### Server Health Dashboard
- **Real-time Status**: Shows if MCP server is running and responsive
- **Connection Info**: Displays server port and response times
- **Available Tools**: Lists all MCP tools currently available

### Issue Management
- **Fetch by Key**: Enter JIRA issue keys (e.g., "MYP-1", "PROJECT-123")
- **Display Details**: Shows issue summary, description, status, priority
- **Parse Requirements**: Automatically extracts component requirements from issue descriptions

### Component Generation
- **Auto-generation**: Creates React components based on JIRA issue descriptions
- **Complete Package**: Generates component code, CSS styles, and tests
- **Best Practices**: Follows React conventions and accessibility standards
- **JIRA Mapping**: Maps JIRA acceptance criteria to component functionality

### Testing & Validation
- **MCP Method Testing**: Test individual MCP server methods
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track request/response times

## 📋 Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Basic Issue Fetching

1. Navigate to `/jira-mcp`
2. Check that server health shows "Healthy"
3. Enter an issue key (e.g., "MYP-1") in the input field
4. Click "Fetch Issue"
5. Review the displayed issue details

### Example 2: Component Generation

1. Fetch an issue as above
2. Click "Generate Component from Issue"
3. Review the generated:
   - Component JSX code
   - CSS styles
   - Test files
   - PropTypes definitions
4. Copy the generated code to create new components

### Example 3: Searching Issues

1. Enter search terms in the search field
2. Click "Search Issues"
3. Browse through multiple matching issues
4. Select specific issues for component generation

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Modern Design
- **Clean Interface**: Minimalist design with clear sections
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded status for easy recognition
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading animations and progress indicators
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with recovery options

### Responsive Layout
- **Mobile-First**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Grid Layout**: Adaptive grid system for component display
- **Navigation**: Collapsible navigation for smaller screens

### Accessibility
- **ARIA Labels**: Full screen reader support
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete keyboard accessibility
- **High Contrast**: Support for high contrast mode
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators

## 🔧 Configuration

### Backend Server Configuration
The backend server (`server/mcpProxy.js`) can be configured via environment variables:

```bash
PORT=3002              # Backend server port
MCP_SERVER_PATH=./path # Path to MCP server executable
```

### React App Configuration
Standard Create React App configuration applies. Key files:

- `src/services/jiraService.js` - JIRA API integration
- `src/components/MCPClient.jsx` - Main MCP interface
- `src/App.js` - Application routing and layout

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Server not healthy" message**
   - Ensure backend server is running on port 3002
   - Check MCP server configuration in `.vscode/mcp.json`
   - Verify MCP server permissions and dependencies

2. **"Failed to fetch issue" errors**
   - Verify JIRA issue keys are correct
   - Check MCP server JIRA configuration
   - Ensure proper authentication is set up

3. **Component generation fails**
   - Verify issue description contains proper component specifications
   - Check MCP server logs for detailed error messages
   - Ensure all required dependencies are installed

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```javascript
// In jiraService.js
const DEBUG = true;
```
