// Custom searches
const results = await jiraService.searchIssues('project = "MYP"');
const recent = await jiraService.searchIssues('updated >= -7d');

// Individual issues
const issue = await jiraService.fetchJiraIssue('MYP-1');
const multiple = await jiraService.fetchMultipleIssues(['MYP-1', 'MYP-2']);
```

### 3. Direct HTTP API Calls
**Base URL**: `http://localhost:3002/api`

```powershell

```

## 📊 Pre-built JQL Queries

### Common Issue Lists
```javascript
// Available in jiraService.getCommonQueries()
{
  myAssigned: 'assignee = currentUser() ORDER BY priority DESC',
  myReported: 'reporter = currentUser() ORDER BY created DESC',
  recentlyUpdated: 'updated >= -7d ORDER BY updated DESC',
  highPriority: 'priority = High ORDER BY created DESC',
  inProgress: 'status = "In Progress" ORDER BY updated DESC',
  uiIssues: 'summary ~ "[UI]" ORDER BY created DESC',
  readyForDev: 'status = "Ready for Development" ORDER BY priority DESC'
}
```

### Advanced Searches
```sql
-- All open issues by priority
status != Done ORDER BY priority DESC, updated DESC

-- Recently created UI enhancements
created >= -14d AND summary ~ "[UI]" ORDER BY created DESC

-- Critical bugs
type = Bug AND priority = Critical ORDER BY created ASC

-- Epic-level issues
type = Epic ORDER BY created DESC

-- Issues with acceptance criteria
description ~ "acceptance criteria" ORDER BY priority DESC

-- Component-specific issues
component = "Frontend" AND status != Done ORDER BY priority DESC

-- Issues ready for implementation
status = "Ready for Development" AND assignee = currentUser()
```

## 🛠️ Current Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: MCP Server Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: `Cannot find module './utils/logger.util.js'`

**Solution**:
```bash
cd "C:\Priyanka\projects\mcp-server-atlassian-jira-main\mcp-server-atlassian-jira-main"
# Create missing utility file or fix import path
```

### Issue 2: TypeScript Compilation Errors
**Problem**: Type declaration issues

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Updated `tsconfig.json` to be more permissive

### Issue 3: JIRA Authentication
**Problem**: MCP server needs JIRA credentials

**Solution**: Configure JIRA connection in MCP server settings

## 🎯 Quick Start (Once Fixed)

1. **Start Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   node server/mcpProxy.js
   ```

2. **Start React App**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **List Issues via Web Interface**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/jira-mcp`
   - Enter search query or issue key
   - View results

4. **List Issues via API**:
   ```bash
   node tools/jira-issues-demo.js
   ```
